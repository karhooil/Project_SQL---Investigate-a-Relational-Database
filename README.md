# **Project SQL - Investigate a Relational Database**

## **Project Overview**
In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. 
As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

The project submission is a presentation, which will be reviewed, and for which you will need to Meet Expectations to pass. 
For the presentation component, you will create four slides. Each slide will:
- Have a question of interest.
- Have a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
- Have a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.

## **Project Details**
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. 
For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, 
how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 
*(Note: One quirk you may notice as you explore this "fake" database is that the rental dates are all from 2005 and 2006, while the payment dates are all from 2007. Don't worry about this.)*

## **Project Submission**
You will submit your project at the end of the project lessons. Your project will include:
- A set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide.
- A text file with your queries needed to answer each of the four questions.

## **Uploaded Folders and Files**
The following folders and files have been uploaded:
- 'erd' folder: this contains the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) of the database
- 'sql' folder: this contains SQL codes to query the database
- '.pptx and .pdf': these are the final output prepared for the project
